Khi lâm trận, thay vì đem bom đến xe tăng Đức, lũ chó lại đem bom đến chỗ xe tăng Liên Xô.</p><p> Do xe tăng Liên Xô chạy dầu còn xe tăng Đức chạy xăng, những chú chó đã chạy về hướng có mùi quen thuộc.</p><p> Không chỉ thế, chó chống tank còn thường đem bom chạy về phe nhà do sợ tiếng súng, khiến nhiều lính Liên Xô bị thương.</p><p> Đôi lúc, chó chống tank từ chối chui vào gầm xe, nên đứng chần chừ bên cạnh những chiếc xe tăng và bị giết sau đó. Nhờ những chú chó này, người Đức đã lấy được mẫu kíp nổ và bom của Liên Xô.</p><p> Việc hi sinh một cách thiếu hiệu quả chó và lính này đã bị lên án dữ dội, tuy nhiên bộ tuyên truyền Liên Xô vẫn báo cáo rằng chó chống tăng tiêu diệt hơn 300 xe tăng Đức.<br> ________________________</p><p> The soviets trained dogs to serve as anti-tank bombers, but because they used soviet tanks to train the dogs, the dogs attacked Russian tanks instead of their German targets. </p><p> The Soviets used their own diesel engine tanks to train the dogs rather than German tanks which had gasoline engines. As the dogs relied on their acute sense of smell, the dogs sought out familiar Soviet tanks instead of strange-smelling German tanks. This effectively meant that the Soviets had trained the dogs to sabotage their own army.</p><p> The first group of anti-tank dogs arrived at the frontline at the end of the summer of 1941 and included 30 dogs and 40 trainers. Their deployment revealed some serious problems. In order to save fuel and ammunition, dogs had been trained on tanks which stood still and did not fire their guns. In the field, the dogs refused to dive under moving tanks. Some persistent dogs ran near the tanks, waiting for them to stop but were shot in the process. Gunfire from the tanks scared away many of the dogs. They would run back to the trenches and often detonated the charge upon jumping in, killing Soviet soldiers.</p><p> To prevent that, the returning dogs had to be shot, often by their controllers and this made the trainers unwilling to work with new dogs. Some went so far as to say that the army did not stop with sacrificing people to the war and went on to slaughter dogs too; those who openly criticized the program were persecuted by "special departments" (military counterintelligence). </p><p> Out of the first group of 30 dogs, only four managed to detonate their bombs near the German tanks, inflicting an unknown amount of damage. Six exploded upon returning to the Soviet trenches, killing and injuring soldiers. </p><p> Three dogs were shot by German troops and taken away, despite furious attempts by the Soviets to prevent this, which provided examples of the detonation mechanism to the Germans.</p><p> There are claims by the Soviet sources that around 300 German tanks were damaged by Soviet anti-tank dogs. This claim was questioned by Russian historians as propaganda, trying to justify the dog training program.</p><p> - Artist: Sam.</p><p> <a class="_58cn" href="/hashtag/monsterbox?__eep__=6&amp;source=feed_text&amp;epa=HASHTAG&amp;__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARBT2CDYy9D9_VyFRbTpLnvofPA_ONkUUCLOiAmeg0LInOwtI8VvSjXgvXDNJXspkKGKLpKKKFimacFThX6Fa9ZjMmwkUwwGHhqldII5JguPI2bsUBYLcCgxtcPVg5Cajh4Za0AJ-ON5B0v-FUgFT6AifMNHVJgO_CeeuRxGNxZz_UegZ7E14enBWJ5jex9AXEGOK0aoxO_mwQwc1ygKT7cacuuMB6f-p1gxPQ6pc2kiYwQKdIXy1PJ23SahIIJedNUuDIl9KsPzcB9s6uASOepwLFKd1ozVaE3DQe9dxHpqnnyfAt7W7uU&amp;__tn__=%2ANK-R" data-ft="{&quot;type&quot;:104,&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;*N&quot;}"><span class="_5afx"><span aria-label="hashtag" class="_58cl _5afz">#</span><span class="_58cm">MonsterBox</span></span></a></p>
